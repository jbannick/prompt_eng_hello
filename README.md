# Code Assist Prompt Engineering (<strong>CAPE</strong>) - Hello Worlds!
## Objective
A collection of Prompt Sets that generate Hello World! code in different coding languages.

Particularly some of the <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE</a> top in-demand languages.

* Katas for languages I know
* Gateway projects for languages I do not know

## About

This project is based on <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/learn-ai-assisted-python-programming">Learn AI-Assisted Python Programming With GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT</a>.  
Conveniently, I've been Pythoning at <a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/">MIT Lincoln Lab</a> for 8 years.  
A great place to start.

## Status

Have:

* Read the book
* Set up the CAPE toolset specified by the book
* Begun doing their programming examples

After I gain an initial familiarity with CAPE, I can apply that knowledge to practical tasks.
