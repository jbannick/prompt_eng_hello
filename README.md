# Code Assist Prompt Engineering - Hello Worlds!
## Objective
A collection of Prompt Sets that generate Hello World code in different coding languages.

## About

This project is based on <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/learn-ai-assisted-python-programming">Learn AI-Assisted Python Programming</a>.
Conveniently, I've been Pythoning for 8 years.

## Status

Have:

* Read the book
* Set up the CAPE toolset specified by the book.
* Begun doing their programming problems

After I gain an initial familiarity with CAPE, I can design a useful introductory prompt set.

The interesting part will be developing a prompt set that is simple but produces more than just: <code>print("Hello World!")</code>.
